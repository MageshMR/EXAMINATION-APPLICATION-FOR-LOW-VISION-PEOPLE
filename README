# Examination Application for Low Vision People

Welcome to the **Examination Application for Low Vision People** – a specially designed, accessible exam platform built to empower students with visual impairments to participate independently and confidently in examinations.

## Project Overview

This application provides a voice-assisted, easy-to-navigate exam environment tailored for low vision and blind students. It uses advanced speech technologies to read questions aloud and allows students to respond either through typing, speaking, or with the help of a scribe. 

The system ensures a smooth, secure, and inclusive exam experience while maintaining academic integrity.

- **Answer Submission**: Students can answer questions by typing, speaking, or through a scribe (with voice recording support).
- **Voice Authentication** (Optional): Secure login using voice recognition technology.
- **Admin Panel**: 
  - Manage student profiles.
  - Upload, view, and update exam questions.
  - Monitor answer submissions.
- **Profile Management**: Students can view and edit their profile, including uploading a profile picture and exporting their profile to PDF.
